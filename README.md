#About Git :Git is a version control system (VCS) that helps you track changes to your files. 
Imagine it as a way to save "checkpoints" of your work. When you edit a file, Git keeps a record of what changed, 
who made the changes, and why. It's like having a time machine for your code! Git is widely used by developers to collaborate on projects, 
manage changes, and ensure code integrity. Plus, it's lightning-fast because most operations happen locally on your computer, 
without needing to connect to a remote server
